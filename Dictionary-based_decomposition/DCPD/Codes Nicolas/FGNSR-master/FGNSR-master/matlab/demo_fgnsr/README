This Matlab demo compares various algorithms for separable NMF perform on an
hyperspectral image data set.  To run the demo, you need to have set up your
Matlab installation so that the 'mex' command is working (typically a compiler
needs to be installed).

To run the demo, simply execute the demo_fgnsr.m script from within Matlab.
