Please run the file "Experiment.m" to compare the different near-separable NMF algorithms on synthetic data sets, as done in Section 4.1 of [1]. 

To run the experiment Dirichlet, you need the Statistics toolbox of Matlab. 

Please report any bug to nicolas.gillis@umons.ac.be. Thanks! 

v2 - small error corrected in the initialization of H in SNPA.m (line 51-52). 

v3 - new synthetic data sets with column-rank-deficient matrices.
