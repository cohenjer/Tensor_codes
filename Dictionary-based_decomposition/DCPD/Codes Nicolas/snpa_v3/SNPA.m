function [J,H] = SNPA(M,r,normalize) 

% Successive Nonnegative Projection Algorithm (variant with f(.) = ||.||^2)
%
% *** Description ***
% At each step of the algorithm, the column of M maximizing ||.||_2 is 
% extracted, and M is updated with the residual of the projection of its 
% columns onto the convex hull of the columns extracted so far.

% [J,H] = SNPA(M,r,normalize) 
%
% ****** Input ******
% M = WH + N : a (normalized) noisy separable matrix, that is, W is full rank, 
%              H = [I,H']P where I is the identity matrix, H'>= 0 and its 
%              columns sum to at most one, P is a permutation matrix, and
%              N is sufficiently small. 
% r          : number of columns to be extracted. 
% normalize  : normalize=1 will scale the columns of M so that they sum to one,
%              hence matrix H will satisfy the assumption above for any
%              nonnegative separable matrix M. 
%              normalize=0 is the default value for which no scaling is
%              performed. For example, in hyperspectral imaging, this 
%              assumption is already satisfied and normalization is not
%              necessary. 
%
% ****** Output ******
% J        : index set of the extracted columns. 
% H        : optimal weights, that is, H argmin_{X >= 0} ||M-M(:,K)X||_F
